Background subtraction is a key technique in computer vision used to distinguish
moving objects (foreground) from a static background in video sequences. It is widely utilized
in applications like surveillance, motion tracking, and video analysis, where the goal is to
detect and isolate dynamic elements within a mostly constant environment.

Abstract :Technique for separating moving foreground objects from static background in
video sequences. Essential for surveillance and motion tracking applications.
The method works by first creating a model of the static background and then comparing
each incoming video frame to this model. Any significant differences between the current frame
and the background model are considered as foreground objects, typically representing motion or
changes in the scene. This allows for real-time detection of moving objects, enabling applications
such as intrusion detection, activity recognition, and object tracking.
